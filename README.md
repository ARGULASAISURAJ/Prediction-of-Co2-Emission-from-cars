# Prediction-of-Co2-Emission-from-cars
In this Project, I used scikit-learn's Multiple linear regression to predict co2 emission from cars based upon 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY' of car. I collected data from Government of Canada's website (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64), dataset related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars made in year 2014.

Data- FuelConsumption.CSV
Python Libraries Used- NumPy,MATPLOTLIB, ScikitLearn, Pandas
